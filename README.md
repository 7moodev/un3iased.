# Web3 for unbiased systems.

## Computation on Data with Homomorphic Encryption

### Overview

This repository is dedicated to exploring the potential of homomorphic encryption in mitigating bias in decision-making processes, with a focus on real-world examples such as banking loans and court judgments. Homomorphic encryption enables computations to be performed on encrypted data without decryption, ensuring privacy while enabling analysis and decision-making.
